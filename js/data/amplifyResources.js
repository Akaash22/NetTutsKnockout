Wanting to make a homestyle lager, but not having the refrigeration needed to ferment at cold temperatures, they developed a special strain of  lager yeast that would ferment at 60* to 64* Fahrenheit. Our Firehole Steam uses this same strain of yeast. Firehole Steam is a signature beer of Rudy Borrego and is named after the Firehole River and the steam-producing thermal features of the greater Yellowstone basin.
